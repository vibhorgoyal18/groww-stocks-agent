Portfolio Rebalancing - 2025-11-12 11:58:05.280980
============================================================
It seems that there's an issue with authentication, as the API token required to execute the trading strategy has either expired or is invalid. To proceed with the portfolio rebalancing strategy, you'll need to ensure that the API token is valid and re-authenticate to enable the execution of buy and sell orders.

In the meantime, I can help with parts of the strategy that don't require direct execution, such as identifying underperformers and finding high-potential replacement stocks. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with those parts while you resolve the authentication issue.
